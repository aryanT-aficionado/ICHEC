# Week 8
This week's task involves implementing Euclid's algorithm for calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers. The algorithm is demonstrated using both iterative and recursive approaches.

Files
1. gcd.c
- Prompts the user to input two positive integers.
- Computes the GCD using:
- Iterative method
- Recursive method

2. random_gcd.c
- Generates two random positive integers between 1 and 20.
- Computes their GCD using:
- Iterative method
- Recursive method
