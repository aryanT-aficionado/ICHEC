# Scientific Programming ICHEC 
## Overview
This repository contains codes, and weekly reports for Scientific Programming ICHEC in C language. 
Weekly codes practised in class every tuesday. 
Each week, I will update this repository, reflecting the learning progress during the course.

## Week-3
1. Loops (For and While)
2. Conditional Statements (If-Else, Switch Case)
3. Combining loops with conditional statements

## Week-4
Code for the trapezoidal rule with tangent values and compares the computed result with the actual value (ln(2)) to determine:
- Absolute difference
- Relative difference

## Week 5
To compute and display a Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms using pointers for efficient computation.
Practical - This program calculates the integral of tan(x) over [0,60deg] using the trapezoidal rule. It compares the computed result with the exact value of ln(2).
