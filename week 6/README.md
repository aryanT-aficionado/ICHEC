## Week 6

The program implements matrix multiplication using a separate function matmult() for matrix multiplication logic.

- Takes matrices of size:

    Matrix A: n × p (5×3)
    Matrix B: p × q (3×4)
    Result Matrix C: n × q (5×4)

Practical-
matrix multiplication for two matrices A and B, storing the result in matrix C.

- Matrix A: 5×3 (n×p)
- Matrix B: 3×4 (p×q)
- Result Matrix C: 5×4 (n×q)
- Matrix A is initialized with values where A[i][j] = i + j
- Matrix B is initialized with values where B[i][j] = i - j
- Matrix C is initialized with zeros before multiplication
